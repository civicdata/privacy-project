# Secure Your Android

* **Use A Pin Passcode.** 
Never use Touch ID as it can be compromised. Make your PIN strong and at least 8 digits. You can find this for Androids under `Settings->Personal->Security->Screen Lock`.
* **Encrypt And Back Up Your Phone.** 
This is automatic with recent versions of Androids. If your device uses Android version 4.0 or newer, you should verify that device encryption is turned on. This can be done in `Settings->Personal->Security->Encryption`. If it is not follow the steps to encrypt. But just make sure that before starting the encryption process you back up your data, ensure the phone is fully charged and plugged into a power source.
* **Set Your Screen To Lock When Not In Use.** 
We recommend that you chose a short amount of time that does not drive you crazy. We use anywhere from 30 sec to a minute. In Android you can find that in `Settings->Personal->Security->Screen Lock`.
* **Clear Your Message Threads Frequently.**  
You’ll find this option in your message screen.  If your phone is confiscated they can compel you to open it, sensitive content can be exposed from your message history.
* **Maintain All Your Android Updates.**  
These updates will have important security patches.  Not doing an update can leave your device vulnerable, go to Settings->About Phone->Updates->Check for updates.
* **Add An App Lock Software.** 
For an added layer of protection we recommend AppLock for Android. You can find this app at the Google Play store.
* **Turn Off Location Services For All But Necessary Actions.**  
Go to `Settings->Personal->Location`. To reduce the risk of location tracking don’t have services running by default in the background, it will saving battery power and reducing unwanted data streams initiated by applications and your mobile carrier. That said your phone can still reveal your location through triangulation so be intentional about when and where you take it.
