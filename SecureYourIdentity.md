Create strong passwords: This means using a password manager to generate passwords for every account. Its important to change your password on a regular basis, preferably at least once every 3 months.  We recommend keepassX at https://keepassx.org/downloads, 1password at https://1password.com/ and last pass at www.lastpass.com

Compartmentalize your email, Facebook, twitter, Instagram, and snapchat accounts.  Keep separate accounts for your family, personal and political identities.  Be careful about cross-contaminating an identity.  Make sure these are set up with different emails and burner phone numbers.  Need help making multiple accounts?  Use email services like riseup.net and burner app which can help you create distinct separate identities. 

Turn on 2 factor authentication (2FA) for all your accounts.  2FA is available for gmail, facebook, Twitter and more.  This website gives you directions on how to do it for all your accounts. Https://www.turnon2fa.com/tutorials/
